    "## Overview\n",
    "This project seeks to predict customer churn for SyriaTel using historical usage and customer service data. By leveraging classification models, we aim to detect patterns that distinguish churners from loyal customers. The end goal is to empower the business with proactive strategies to reduce churn and retain high-value customers. The full machine learning lifecycle is followedâ€”from problem framing and data exploration to model development and business recommendations."
